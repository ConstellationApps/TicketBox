Constellation Ticket Box
========================

The Constellation Ticket Box module implements a lightweight ticketing system that allows for filing, replying to, updating the status of, and archiving tickets. 
The Ticket Box system organizes tickets into boxes, where permissioned groups can manage filed tickets.
This module depends on the Constellation Base package.
